# Automation Exposure by Occupation – ISCO-08

This repository accompanies the paper:

**Oleš, Tomáš (2025, forthcoming). _In-Demand Skills: A Shield Against Automation – Evidence from Online Job Vacancies._ Journal for Labour Market Research.**

It provides code and data for measuring occupational exposure to automation technologies—AI, machine learning, software, and robotics—based on semantic similarity between patent texts and ISCO-08 task descriptions. The methodology follows Autor et al. (2024) and extends it to a European context.
